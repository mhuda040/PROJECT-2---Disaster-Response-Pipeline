# PROJECT 2:  DISASTER RESPONSE PIPELINE PROJECT

This project will use a machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency messages.  The data comes from Figure Eight, which we will use to build our model for the emergency messages API.

## Required Files:
- Data
  - process_data.py:  This script will read in the input data from the required CSV files, clean the data in the file, and store the new data in an SQLite database
  - disaster_categories.csv, disaster_messages.csv:  The required CSV files
  - DisasterResponse.db:  The SQLite database created from process_data.py
